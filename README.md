# Credit_Risk_Analysis

In this analysis, we build and evaluate several machine learning models to assess credit risk, using data from LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company.
We first compared four resampling methods using logistic regression model. Then we evaluated the performences of two ensemble classifiers and made recomendations.
