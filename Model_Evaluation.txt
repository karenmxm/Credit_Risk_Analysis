1. Compare Resampling Methods Using Logistic Regression Model

    Precision and Recall Scores:
    Precision = TP/(TP + FP). It measures among all predicted positive cases, how many are truly positive.
    Recall = TP/(TP + FN). It measures among all true positive cases, how many are correctly predicted.

    Random Oversampling: high_risk precision score 0.01, recall score 0.74
                         low_risk precision score 1.00, recall score 0.58
    SMOTE Oversampling: high_risk precision score 0.01, recall score 0.62
                         low_risk precision score 1.00, recall score 0.68
    Under Sampling:     high_risk precision score 0.01, recall score 0.68
                         low_risk precision score 1.00, recall score 0.41
    Combination Sampling: high_risk precision score 0.01, recall score 0.72
                         low_risk precision score 1.00, recall score 0.57
    
    
    Balanced Accuracy Score:
    Balanced accuracy score calculates the fraction of samples predicted correctly with balanced data. 
    
    Across the four sampling methods:
    Random Oversampling: 0.6603;
    SMOTE Oversampling: 0.6537;
    Under Sampling: 0.5474;
    Combination Sampling: 0.6448.

    We care more about among all actual high_risk customers, how many can be correctly predicted.
    So we recomend Random Oversampling method since its balanced accuracy score is highest and recall scores
    for high_risk is the highest among all four sampling methods. 

2. Evaluate Ensemble classifiers 

    We compare the performence of two classifiers:
    Balanced RandomForest Classifier and Easy Ensemble Classifier.

    Balanced accuracys core:

    Balanced RandomForest Classifier: 0.7855
    Easy Ensemble Classifier: 0.9317

    Precision and Recall Scores:

    Balanced RandomForest: high_risk precision score 0.04, recall score 0.67
                           low_risk precision score 1.00, recall score 0.90
    Easy Ensemble Classifier: high_risk precision score 0.09, recall score 0.92
                              low_risk precision score 1.00, recall score 0.94
    
    We recomend Easy Ensemble Classifier since it gets higher balanced accuracy score,
    higher precision score and higher recall score for both high_risk and low_risk cases
    than Balanced RandomForest Classifier.
